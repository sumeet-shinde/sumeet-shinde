### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Web Developer, MERN Stack Learner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60615344/158396074-38503017-b033-4849-bcc4-379ad05b891d.png)

I am a web developer, really passionate about my work because I like the kind of work which will help others to do their work easily. After engineering, I decided to be a web developer. I choose this domain because every company needs their own website to be there on the internet, whether it is for, explaining what they are doing or giving tech-related services to the people and it is easily accessible user donâ€™t need to install any software but they need a web browser to reach any site.

Now I am learning Javascript and MERN Stack (Mongo, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) so that I would be skilled enough to be hired.

Currently, I am in Masai School which is the learning platform to be a Full Stack Web Developer. Now I can say that I can build web applications from scratch. Masai School really helped me, to be skilled enough to build these applications, do check out my repository projects to get an idea of what I am worth.
